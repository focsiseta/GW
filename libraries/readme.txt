unzip the archive in this folder, inside there are assimp glad and glfw, I don't really expect anybody to read this,
but if you are, once unziped you simply set the linker in visual studio to use the libraries. If you wanna know how, 
learnopengl has a great page about what needs to be done, you will still encouter issues when setting up this exact code
because I screwd-up writing some paths and I changed some .h of the libraries to work with my settings.
If you are really THAT interested in working with me, send me an email at d.cardarelli.work@gmail.com .
